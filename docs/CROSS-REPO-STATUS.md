# Cross-Repo Coordination Status

**Purpose:** Rolling tracker of coordination items between `lamboot-tools-dev` and `lamboot-dev` per `SPEC-LAMBOOT-TOOLKIT-V1.md` §14.5. (PVE tooling lives in `lamboot-tools-dev/pve/` subtree per founder decision 2026-04-22; there is no separate companion repo.)

**Review cadence:** Monthly. Update this file at every quarterly release-planning meeting + whenever a coordination item changes state.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-04-23 — lamboot-dev **v0.8.4 SHIPPED** publicly
at 2026-04-23T04:39Z
(<https://github.com/lamco-admin/lamboot/releases/tag/v0.8.4>).

**Mirror counterpart:** `~/lamboot-dev/docs/CROSS-REPO-STATUS.md` — keep
these two files in sync. Owner perspective is flipped between them.

## 1. Active coordination items (v0.2.0 release cycle)

### 1.1 Must have — blocks coordinated v0.2.0 release

| Item | Responsible repo | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hookscript rewrite to fw_cfg file-reference pattern | lamboot-dev | ✅ SHIPPED in `v0.8.4` (lamboot-dev `2892446`) — integration test PASS | Proxmox integration test on pve.a.lamco.io VM 120 passed all 8 verifications. Rewritten hookscript is schema-compatible writer for `/var/lib/lamboot/<VMID>.json`. `lamboot-pve-setup doctor-hookscript` confirmed detection works. Test report in lamboot-dev `docs/analysis/V0.8.4-PROXMOX-INTEGRATION-TEST-2026-04-22.md`. |
| `/etc/lamboot/fleet.toml` schema consumption | lamboot-dev (hookscript, monitor.py) | ✅ SHIPPED in `v0.8.4` (lamboot-dev `2892446` + `ada5cb6`) | Verified working end-to-end in integration test: fleet.toml `[roles]."120"` override correctly produced `role=test-integration-subject` in the per-VM JSON. |
| `lamboot-install --toolkit-prompt` opt-in | lamboot-dev | ✅ Landed in lamboot-dev `c4a9b4e` | `--install-toolkit` / `--no-install-toolkit` flags + interactive `[y/N]` prompt on TTY. Distro-aware install guidance (Fedora/RHEL Copr; Debian/Ubuntu/Arch source tarball). Skipped on `--dry-run`, `--update`, `--quiet`, partial failure. |
| README / USER-GUIDE cross-reference to toolkit | lamboot-dev | ✅ Landed in lamboot-dev `b812fea` + `51ce546` | README has "Diagnostic and repair utilities" section linking `github.com/lamco-admin/lamboot-tools`. `docs/LAMBOOT-TOOLS-OVERVIEW.md` rewritten for 11 tools across three RPM subpackages. |

### 1.2 Should have — important but not blocking

| Item | Responsible repo | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cross-reference `KEY-GENERATION.md` → `lamboot-signing-keys` | lamboot-dev | ✅ Landed in lamboot-dev `51ce546` | §10 "Operator tooling" section with subcommand list. |
| Cross-reference `SECURE-BOOT-AND-SIGNING-STRATEGY.md` → tool | lamboot-dev | ✅ Landed in lamboot-dev `51ce546` | Operator-tooling section maps `sign-binary`/`rotate`/`verify` subcommands to spec procedures. |
| Cross-reference `OVMF-VARS-PROXMOX.md` → `lamboot-pve-ovmf-vars` | lamboot-dev | ✅ Landed in lamboot-dev `51ce546` | §12 notes mirror relationship; `tools/build-ovmf-vars.sh` remains canonical source. |

### 1.3 Release coordination

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Combined release announcement (bootloader v0.8.4 + toolkit v0.2.0 including PVE subpackage) | ⏳ Not drafted | Ship as one coordinated press release; two repos, three RPM subpackages. |
| Cross-linked release notes | ⏳ Not drafted | Each repo's CHANGELOG references the other. |

## 2. Canonical source map (§14.2 of spec)

Files mirrored at release-build time. **Canonical source is authoritative — never edit mirrors directly.**

| File | Canonical location | Mirrored to | Mirror script |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lamboot-inspect` (Python exec) | `~/lamboot-dev/tools/lamboot-inspect` | `lamboot-tools-dev/tools/lamboot-inspect` | `publish/mirror-from-lamboot-dev.sh` |
| `lamboot_inspect/` (Python pkg dir) | `~/lamboot-dev/tools/lamboot_inspect/` | `lamboot-tools-dev/tools/lamboot_inspect/` | same |
| `lamboot-inspect.1` (man page) | `~/lamboot-dev/tools/lamboot-inspect.1` | `lamboot-tools-dev/man/lamboot-inspect.1` | same |
| `lamboot-monitor.py` | `~/lamboot-dev/tools/lamboot-monitor.py` | `lamboot-tools-dev/pve/tools/lamboot-pve-monitor` (renamed) | `publish/mirror-pve-from-lamboot-dev.sh` |
| `build-ovmf-vars.sh` | `~/lamboot-dev/tools/build-ovmf-vars.sh` | `lamboot-tools-dev/pve/tools/lamboot-pve-ovmf-vars` (renamed) | same |
| `lamboot-hookscript.pl` | `~/lamboot-dev/tools/lamboot-hookscript.pl` | **NOT mirrored** — documented dependency; user installs via lamboot-dev | N/A |
| `KEY-GENERATION.md` | `~/lamboot-dev/docs/KEY-GENERATION.md` | Referenced by toolkit website; not mirrored | N/A |

### 2.1 Mirror verification

Each mirror script writes a `MIRROR-CHECKSUMS.txt` file recording sha256 of the canonical source at mirror time. CI verifies no drift between mirrored copy and canonical source (toolkit CI clones lamboot-dev at the matching release tag, re-mirrors, and diffs).

## 3. Schema stability commitments

| Schema | Owner | Consumers | Stability contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/etc/lamboot/fleet.toml` v1 | lamboot-tools-dev (§16 Appendix C) | `lamboot-pve-setup`, `lamboot-pve-fleet`, lamboot-dev's `lamboot-hookscript.pl`, lamboot-dev's `lamboot-monitor.py` | Additive changes OK within v1; breaking changes require `schema_version` bump + coordinated release |
| Per-VM JSON v1 (`/var/lib/lamboot/<VMID>.json`) | lamboot-tools-dev (`lamboot-pve-setup`) | LamBoot inside VM (reads via fw_cfg), lamboot-dev's hookscript (writes) | Same additive policy |
| Toolkit JSON output schema v1 | lamboot-tools-dev (SPEC §5) | External consumers (Grafana, Prometheus, custom tooling) | SEMVER-STABLE within major version; breaking changes bump toolkit major |
| Trust-log events v2 | lamboot-dev (SDS-4 §6) | `lamboot-diagnose` reads trust-log; `lamboot-inspect` deep-reads | Additive tokens OK; renames are major-version event |
